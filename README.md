> A blog system that uses Github Issues

[TURK√áE](https://github.com/bufgix/github-blog/blob/master/READMETR.md)

The usual blog system. Except, all the backend is connected to Github. All blog posts are linked to the issues of a repo that you want.

## Installation

Download the repo to your file system

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/bufgix/github-blog && cd github-blog
```

Install the required dependencies

```sh
$ yarn
# or
$ npm install
```

then come to `config.js` and write your information

```javascript
export default {
  // Github username
  username: "bufgix",
  // Repo name where you will write your blogs
  repoName: "bufgix.github.io",
  // If you want, you can automatically add a CV that based
  // on your github profile. It will appear on the homepage
  useGithubCv: true
};
```

Github-blog uses [Github API V4](https://developer.github.com/v4/), which uses graphql to pull data. That's why [Github access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) is needed. Create a token and give the following permissions

- read:user
- user:email
- user:follow

Copy the token and paste it into a `.env` file as follows

```env
GITHUB_TOKEN=0f49a4540d7efc7272533bc5ba23243da8de8ecd
```

Then to run your blog locally

```sh
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```

## Publising Your Blog

I use [zeit.co](https://zeit.co/), which is both easy and free. Download [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/download) to upload your blog to zeit. Then add the github token to the Now CLI

```sh
$ now secrets add GITHUB_TOKEN <YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN>
```

Publish your application with this command

```sh
$ now deploy
```

After setting your project name, you can follow the application from zeit.co.

## Publishing Articles

Submit a issue to the issues section of the repo that you specified in `config.json`.
Then create a label named `Blog` and add it to your issue. Please note that issues without blog tag will not be shown. You can also create other tags and show what your post is about.

I inspired the project from [this](https://github.com/saadpasta/react-blog-github) repo. Although basically doing the same, I made the project write with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to be SEO friendly
